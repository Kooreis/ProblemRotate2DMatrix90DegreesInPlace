# Question: How do you rotate a 2D matrix by 90 degrees in-place? C# Summary

The C# program rotates a 2D matrix by 90 degrees in-place. It first defines a 2D matrix and then calls the `RotateMatrix` method to perform the rotation. This method works by iterating over the matrix in a layer-by-layer manner, starting from the outermost layer and working its way towards the center. For each layer, it performs a four-way swap of the elements at the corresponding positions in the current layer, effectively rotating the elements in that layer by 90 degrees. The `RotateMatrix` method uses a temporary variable to hold the value of the element being moved to prevent it from being overwritten. After the rotation, the `PrintMatrix` method is called to print the rotated matrix to the console. This method iterates over the matrix and prints each element followed by a space, moving to a new line after each row. The program thus solves the problem of rotating a 2D matrix by 90 degrees in-place by performing a series of in-place swaps of the matrix elements.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution uses the same logic as the C# version to rotate the matrix. Both versions use a nested loop to iterate over the elements of the matrix and swap them in a way that results in a 90-degree rotation. The main difference lies in the syntax and some language-specific features.

1. Array Declaration: In C#, a 2D array is declared using commas between square brackets (e.g., `int[,] matrix`). In Python, a 2D list (which serves the same purpose as a 2D array in C#) is declared as a list of lists (e.g., `matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`).

2. Array Length: In C#, the length of a dimension of an array is obtained using the `GetLength` method (e.g., `matrix.GetLength(0)`). In Python, the length of a list is obtained using the `len` function (e.g., `len(matrix)`).

3. Integer Division: In C#, integer division is performed using the `/` operator. In Python, integer division is performed using the `//` operator.

4. Print Statements: In C#, the `Console.Write` and `Console.WriteLine` methods are used to print to the console. In Python, the `print` function is used.

5. Main Function: In C#, the `Main` method is the entry point of the program. In Python, the `main` function is defined and then called within a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. This is a common idiom in Python for specifying the entry point of a script when it's run directly, but not when it's imported as a module.

6. Function Definitions: In C#, functions are defined using the `static` keyword, the return type, and the function name. In Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword and the function name. Python functions do not specify a return type.

# Java Differences

Both the C# and Java versions solve the problem in a similar way. They both define a 2D matrix and then call a method to rotate the matrix in-place. After the rotation, they print out the matrix. The rotation method in both versions performs the rotation by swapping elements layer by layer, starting from the outermost layer and working its way towards the center.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences between the C# and Java languages themselves:

1. Array Declaration: In C#, a 2D array is declared as `int[,] matrix`, while in Java it's declared as `int[][] matrix`.

2. Array Length: In C#, the length of the array is obtained using `matrix.GetLength(0)`, while in Java it's obtained using `matrix.length`.

3. Print Statements: In C#, `Console.Write` and `Console.WriteLine` are used to print to the console, while in Java `System.out.print` and `System.out.println` are used.

4. Method Declaration: In C#, methods are declared as `static void MethodName`, while in Java they're declared as `public static void methodName`.

5. Main Method: In C#, the main method is `static void Main(string[] args)`, while in Java it's `public static void main(String[] args)`.

6. The Java version uses an additional variable `offset` in the rotation method, which is calculated as `i - first`. This is not present in the C# version, where the equivalent calculation is done directly in the array index.

Overall, the logic of the solution is the same in both languages, with differences only in syntax and language-specific methods.
